# Personalized Context-Aware Depression Detection via Hierarchical Temporal Contrastive Learning
Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions worldwide and often goes undetected due to limitations in traditional diagnostic methods, which rely on infrequent clinical visits and subjective self-reports. These approaches may fail to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of depressive symptoms. With the rise of wearable devices and smartphones, it is now feasible to passively collect continuous streams of behavioral, physiological, and contextual data—such as sleep patterns, physical activity, phone usage, and social interaction—which can serve as proxies for mental well-being. 
# Dataset
This study utilizes the GLOBEM dataset (https://the-globem.github.io), a publicly available but restricted-access resource specifically designed for longitudinal human behavior modeling. The dataset was collected over a four-year period (2018–2021) and includes records from 497 unique participants, amounting to 705 person-years of data. It captures daily life patterns through passive sensing from smartphones and wearable devices, providing multimodal information such as physical activity, sleep, digital engagement, and contextual metadata.
The complete dataset has a size of approximately 3 GB and can be accessed via PhysioNet (https://physionet.org/content/globem/1.1/). <br>
Since this is a restricted-access resource, interested researchers must comply with the following requirements before download approval is granted:
- Account Registration – Create a PhysioNet user account.
- Data Use Agreement – Review and electronically sign the data use agreement outlining ethical usage and privacy considerations.
- Research Purpose Declaration – Provide a brief description of the intended research use.
- Approval – Wait for access approval from the PhysioNet data custodians before initiating the download.
- complete required training:
  - CITI Data or Specimens Only Research
  - You may submit your training here.
  - sign the data use agreement for the project
<br>
Only after fulfilling these requirements can researchers download and utilize the dataset for academic and non-commercial purposes.
